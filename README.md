   The House of Multiplication (HoM) is an application for learning multiplication 1 to
 9 that can be played by two players, namely player 1 and player 2. One player will win
 when he can arrange the answers as many as four in a row, either vertically, horizontally,
 or diagonally. In addition, one player will win when the other player misplaces the answer.
 The game will be considered a draw after there are 32 answers with each player placing 16
 answers but no player has managed to arrange four correct answers in a row.
 
   Based on the HoM game method, it can be concluded that this game is similar to
 the Lomba Rumah Perkalian (LRP) game which is an annual program of HIMATIKA
 FMIPA Unesa, so the LRP game can be played online through the HoM application.
 
   However, this HoM game has not been able to present rules that are as similar
 as possible to offline LRP. For the future, it will be attempted to make it as similar as
 possible to LRP so that users can clearly know how the LRP game is done offline.
